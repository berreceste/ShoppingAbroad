# ShoppingAbroad
The main purposes of the project, which is called shopping abroad, is to buy the product that the user cannot obtain from her country due to stock or similar reasons, or to ensure that people living in geographies that are socio-culturally and economically inadequate can easily access the products they want in terms of product diversity.
